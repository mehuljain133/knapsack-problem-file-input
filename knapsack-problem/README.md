# Knapsack Problem
The Knapsack Problem is an optimization problem. Given a set of items each with a pair of values representing weight and value of the item, the algorithm must determine the maximum possible value for the knapsack such that the combined weight of the items in the knapsack does not exceed it's capacity.

The code takes a text file as input via command line argument. The first line must contain the total size of the knapsack and the number of items listed in the following lines, then each line must contain a pair of values for the value and weight of the item.

Example:   
5 4    
500 4    
400 2    
300 1    
450 3    

# To run the code:
Compile with g++ and run ./\<executable\> \<txt>
